## Setup

### Step 1 - Environment
Make sure your environment is set up to support node. Follow these instructions: https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/environment

### Step 2 - Install Ionic CLI
This will be a command-line interface that will allow you to build and run the project very easily. Follow these instructions: https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/cli

### Step 3 - Running The Project
At this point, you should be able to simply run `ionic serve` from the main directory of the repo to get the project running. If prompted to install @angular/cli then please input Yes (Y) and install the angular interface tool. Any changes made and saved to the code will dynamically update the front-end!
