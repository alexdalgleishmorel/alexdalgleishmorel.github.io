# CPSC 481 - Final Project Fall 2023
## T01 Group 4 - NorthWest Medical Clinic Schedule System

## Setup

### Step 1 - Environment
Make sure your environment is set up to support node. Follow these instructions: https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/environment

### Step 2 - Install Ionic CLI
This will be a command-line interface that will allow you to build and run the project very easily. Follow these instructions: https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/cli

### Step 3 - Running The Project
At this point, you should be able to simply run `ionic serve` from the main directory of the repo to get the project running. Any changes made and saved to the code will dynamically update the front-end!

## ***NOTES***
Toggling between light and dark mode can be done by editing line 79 of `clinic-schedule/src/theme/variables.scss`.
